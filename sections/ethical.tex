\section{Ethical Considerations}

This study received ethical approval from the Wits Human Research Ethics Committee (reference 220606) and complies with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations (45 CFR 46). Privacy protection includes data minimization, secure servers with restricted access, and geographical jittering/aggregation in compliance with South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA, 2013).

For secondary data usage, contractual guarantees from data providers confirm appropriate consent practices. Ethical risks—such as re-identification, secondary consent issues, and community stigmatization—are mitigated through data aggregation, secure storage, broad consent waivers, and responsible community engagement.

Detailed POPIA compliance framework and data protection procedures are provided in Appendix B.
