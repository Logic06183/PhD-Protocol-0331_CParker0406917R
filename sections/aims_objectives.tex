\subsection{Primary Research Question}
This study addresses the following primary research question: \textit{How do urban form, socio-demographic characteristics, and climate factors interact to shape heat vulnerability and health outcomes in Johannesburg, and what interventions could effectively reduce heat-related health impacts?}

Specific sub-questions include: (1) spatial distribution of heat vulnerabilities; (2) mediating factors in heat-health relationships; (3) effectiveness of current adaptation strategies; and (4) optimal infrastructural and policy interventions.

\subsection{Objectives}
This research is structured around three interconnected objectives:

\subsubsection{Objective 1: Geographically Weighted Heat Vulnerability Mapping}
Develop comprehensive spatial vulnerability assessment using geographically weighted approaches that account for spatial non-stationarity. This will identify patterns of heat risk across Johannesburg's diverse urban landscape, examine how historical development patterns shape contemporary vulnerability, and identify priority intervention areas with particular emphasis on infrastructural and socio-spatial inequities.

\subsubsection{Objective 2: Causal Mechanisms of Heat-Health Relationships}
Identify causal mechanisms underlying observed patterns of heat vulnerability through advanced explanatory modeling. This involves investigating which biological systems are most affected by heat stress, how these impacts vary across demographic groups, and what socioeconomic factors mediate these effects.

\subsubsection{Objective 3: Predictive Modeling for Early Warning Systems}
Develop predictive models incorporating near-real-time environmental data, meteorological forecasts, and vulnerability factors to predict heat-health risks. This includes identifying critical temperature thresholds and neighborhood-specific warning indicators to support short-term emergency response and longer-term adaptation planning.

These four objectives form an integrated research framework addressing spatial, physiological, temporal, and policy dimensions of heat vulnerability. The research design builds each objective upon the findings of the previous one, creating a cohesive pathway from vulnerability characterization to mechanistic understanding to practical solution development.
