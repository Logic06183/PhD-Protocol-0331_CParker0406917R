\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Study Design}
This study employs a mixed-methods design integrating quantitative geospatial analysis with qualitative community-engaged research across four phases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Vulnerability Mapping} - Developing geographically weighted heat vulnerability indices
    \item \textbf{Causal Analysis} - Identifying key causal pathways and mechanisms
    \item \textbf{Intervention Assessment} - Evaluating effectiveness of existing interventions
    \item \textbf{Policy Translation} - Developing evidence-based policy recommendations
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Sources and Collection}
Health data spanning 2000--2022 will be drawn from clinical trials and cohort studies conducted in Johannesburg that meet defined inclusion criteria: cohorts or trials with 200 adult participants, prospectively collected data, comprehensive clinical and laboratory variables, and appropriate ethics approvals. The dataset will include clinical indicators and laboratory tests covering renal, metabolic and inflammatory markers and demographic/socioeconomic factors. Given potential confounding effects, 2020--2022 data will undergo stratified analysis to account for pandemic-related influences on healthcare utilization and outcomes. A comprehensive overview of all data sources is provided in Appendix Table 1.

\subsubsection{Environmental and Socioeconomic Data}
Environmental parameters will be derived from multiple validated sources, including Landsat 8 \citep{landsat8}, Sentinel-2 \citep{sentinel2}, ERA5 reanalysis \citep{era5}, and the Copernicus Climate Data Store \citep{copernicus_climate_data_store}. These data streams will provide high-resolution measurements of Land Surface Temperature, vegetation indices, air temperature, and derived heat metrics. Socioeconomic determinants will be incorporated through ward-level data from the Gauteng City-Region Observatory Quality of Life Surveys \citep{gcro_qol_survey}, capturing housing quality, infrastructure adequacy, and healthcare access. The data processing and integration workflow is detailed in Appendix Table 2, with specific security measures outlined in Appendix Table 3.

\subsubsection{Health and Socioeconomic Data}
We will integrate: daily mortality records and hospital admission data (with focus on cardiovascular, respiratory, and heat-specific diagnoses), demographic variables from Statistics South Africa, social vulnerability indicators (housing quality, utility access), pre-existing health condition prevalence, and COVID-19 data to assess potential interactive effects with heat vulnerability. All datasets will be harmonized to comparable spatial units for integrated analysis.

\subsubsection{Sample Size Justification}
The study's statistical power is ensured through comprehensive data coverage and adequate sample sizes. For vulnerability mapping, data from all 135 wards provide complete spatial coverage. For the explanatory and predictive modelling components, the combined dataset of approximately 5,000--7,000 records substantially exceeds the minimum requirement of 10-20 observations per predictive feature (with 20-25 features anticipated). This sample size provides >80\% power to detect clinically meaningful effects, calculated as:

\begin{equation}
n = \frac{2(Z_{\alpha/2} + Z_{\beta})^2\sigma^2}{\Delta^2}
\end{equation}

where $Z_{\alpha/2}$ and $Z_{\beta}$ are standard normal deviates for type I and II errors, $\sigma^2$ is the expected variance, and $\Delta$ is the minimal detectable effect size.

\subsection{Analytical Approaches}

\subsubsection{Geographically Weighted Vulnerability Mapping}\label{gwpca}
A key innovation in this study is the application of Geographically Weighted Principal Component Analysis (GWPCA), which accounts for spatially heterogeneous relationships between vulnerability indicators \citep{Quispe2023, Praharaj2024}. This is crucial in Johannesburg given its extreme socio-spatial fragmentation. The GWPCA approach includes: (1) indicator selection across exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity domains; (2) spatial bandwidth optimization through cross-validation; (3) local component extraction allowing vulnerability factors to vary spatially; (4) construction of location-specific vulnerability indices; (5) spatial mapping; and (6) comparative analysis between global and local statistical approaches. Implementation will utilize the GWmodel package in R.

\subsubsection{Causal Machine Learning Approaches}
To move beyond correlation and identify causal mechanisms linking urban form, socioeconomic conditions, and heat-health outcomes, we will employ: (1) causal structure learning using the PC algorithm to discover potential causal relationships; (2) causal effect estimation using double machine learning and causal forests to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of specific urban features; and (3) causal mediation analysis to quantify direct and indirect pathways through which urban characteristics influence health outcomes. Implementation will use causal-learn and econml Python packages, with sensitivity analyses to assess robustness.

\subsection{Objective 1: Vulnerability Mapping}
Geospatial data will undergo rigorous preprocessing, including normalization, completeness assessments, and spatial harmonization. The methodology employs Geographically Weighted Principal Component Analysis (GWPCA) \citep{Harris2011, Quispe2023} to develop a comprehensive Heat Vulnerability Index that accounts for spatial non-stationarity in vulnerability relationships.

\subsection{Objective 2: Explanatory Modeling}
The explanatory modelling framework employs a two-stage clinical-computational approach examining both physiological pathways and temporal effects of heat exposure. This framework harmonizes data from multiple cohort studies to investigate underlying mechanisms across different physiological systems.

\subsubsection{Clinical Pathway Validation}
Working with clinical experts, we will develop comprehensive physiological pathway diagrams representing hypothesized heat-health mechanisms at multiple biological levels. These diagrams will be rigorously validated through expert consensus panels and systematic literature review, establishing physiologically plausible causal pathways before computational analysis.

\subsubsection{Temporal Heat Exposure Modeling}
To capture the dynamic nature of heat exposure, we will develop spatiotemporal models that characterize: (1) diurnal patterns of day-night temperature variations; (2) seasonal variations between summer and winter; (3) extreme heat events and their spatiotemporal distributions; and (4) long-term trends under climate change scenarios. These analyses will employ time series modeling, extreme value theory, and climate downscaling approaches.

\subsection{Objective 3: Predictive Modeling}
The predictive framework integrates environmental, socioeconomic, and health data to forecast heat-related health outcomes within a 24--72 hour horizon. The methodology employs advanced feature engineering combining domain knowledge with statistical selection techniques including mutual information analysis and recursive feature elimination with cross-validation to identify optimal predictive variables while controlling for collinearity.

Rather than relying on a single algorithm, the approach employs a carefully calibrated ensemble that combines gradient boosting methods, random forests, and other algorithms through a meta-learning framework. For the gradient boosting component, the objective function being optimized is:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \sum^n_{i=1} l(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \sum^K_{k=1} \Omega(f_k)
\end{equation}

where $l$ is the loss function comparing the prediction $\hat{y}_i$ with the target $y_i$, and $\Omega$ represents the regularization term controlling model complexity.

The validation strategy employs forward-chaining time-series cross-validation to realistically simulate forecasting scenarios, with performance evaluated using metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC):

\subsubsection{Model Accuracy and Reliability Measures}
To ensure predictive model accuracy and reliability, particularly across Johannesburg's diverse urban contexts, we will implement a comprehensive validation framework. This includes: (1) spatially stratified cross-validation to test model performance across different urban morphologies; (2) out-of-distribution detection methods to identify and address anomalous predictions; (3) uncertainty quantification through conformal prediction intervals; and (4) regular recalibration procedures to maintain model accuracy over time. Our model evaluation will employ metrics beyond traditional accuracy measures (AUC-ROC, F1) to include reliability diagrams, expected calibration error, and variable-specific sensitivity analyses. This approach ensures that predictions remain valid across the city's diverse built environments and socioeconomic contexts, with explicit reliability assessments for informal settlements and areas undergoing rapid urban transformation.

\subsection{Forecast Window Selection}
The 24--72 hour forecast window was selected based on three key considerations. First, physiological evidence indicates that significant heat-health impacts manifest within 1-3 days of exposure \citep{Gasparrini2015, Kinney2020}, making this the critical intervention window for preventative healthcare measures. Second, meteorological forecast accuracy significantly degrades beyond 72 hours, particularly for urban microclimates, limiting the actionable reliability of longer-term predictions. Third, stakeholder consultations with healthcare providers indicated that a 1-3 day window optimally balances advance warning with operational response capabilities in Johannesburg's healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis will test alternative windows (12--24 hours and 72--120 hours) to assess the stability of predictive relationships across different temporal scales.

\begin{equation}
\text{AUC-ROC} = \int^1_0 TPR(FPR^{-1}(t))dt
\end{equation}

where $TPR$ is the true positive rate and $FPR$ is the false positive rate at different classification thresholds.

The modelling output translates into actionable intelligence through stratified risk profiles, geospatial risk mapping, and population-specific threshold recommendations. This translation from statistical prediction to practical application ensures research findings can directly inform heat-health interventions and resource allocation for vulnerable populations in Johannesburg.
